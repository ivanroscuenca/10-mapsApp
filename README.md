# MapsApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.4.

## App using MapBox

- Handling JavaScript libraries in TypeScript
- Using Mapbox-based Maps (the API is similar to Google Maps)
- Markers
- Events
- FlyTo
- Geographic coordinates
- Components for map reusability
- Persistent object management
- @types
- Zoom
- Range
- And more

Although map usage is not directly related to Angular, as everything is done through an object from a third-party library, in this case Mapbox, it's interesting to understand how these libraries work within Angular and how to have control over objects as if they were properties of our classes.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
